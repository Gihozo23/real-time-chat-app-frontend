# Real-time chat application

Building a responsive and user-friendly application where:

- Users should be able to enter a chat room, send and receive messages to other users in real-time
- Users should be able to see a list of chat rooms they can join.
- Messages should be displayed in a chat window, grouped by conversation.

## React + Vite

Started with a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
